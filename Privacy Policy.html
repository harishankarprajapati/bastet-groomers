        <h3 class="sec-privacy-h"> DISPUTES RESOLUTIONS POLICY</h3>

        <p class="sec-privacy-p">Generally, transactions are conducted smoothly on Petdos, however there may be some
            cases where both the Buyers and Sellers may face issues. At Petdos, we have a Dispute Resolution process in
            order to resolve disputes between Buyers and Sellers.
        </p>
        <p class="sec-privacy-p">What is a 'dispute'? - A 'Dispute' can be defined as a disagreement between a Buyer and
            a Seller in connection with a transaction on the Platform.
        </p>
        <p class="sec-privacy-p">How does a 'dispute' occur in the Marketplace? - Disputes are filed as a result of a
            disagreement between the Buyer and the Seller. Disputes arise out of an issue that is raised by either party
            not being completely satisfied with the resolution of their complaint/issue.
        </p>
        <p class="sec-privacy-p">It is important that before a Buyer/Seller raises a dispute, they should attempt to
            solve the issue. Please note that whenever a Buyer raises a dispute, the Seller's payment for that order is
            put on hold immediately until the issue is resolved.
        </p>
        <p class="sec-privacy-p">How is a 'dispute' created? - Whenever there is a disagreement, the Buyer can write to
            admin@bastet-groomers.com, while the Seller can write to admin@bastet-groomers.com, in order to raise a dispute.
            Disputes can be raised at a particular transaction level.
        </p>
        <p class="sec-privacy-p">What are the various types of 'disputes'? - Following are the indicative examples of
            potential disputes:
        </p>
        <p class="sec-privacy-p">Wrong item received;
        </p>
